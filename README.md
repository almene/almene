I am currently in the final stages of attaining my PhD in Bioinformatics at the University
of Guelph.  My current work foccusses around clustering and how the input data intearcts with the chosen hierarchical clustering algorithm.

I have previously assisted in module development as part of an automatic salmonella scheme pipeline.
